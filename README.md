# Think-it Web Challenge: Gaming Charts - Junior ðŸ’¥

## The problem
The goal is to create a SPA that enables the user to search for the top games by playtime or by number of unique users.

The application should consist of two components:

- A backend that serves the data to the frontend
- An SPA that consumes the endpoints exposed by the backend and displays the data to the user.

## Demo

## How to run
### from backend folder:
```
nodemon start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
or
```
npm start
```
The backend is set to run on port **3100** if no port is provided through environments variables

### then frontend folder:
```
yarn start
```
or
```
npm start
```

## Tests
### Implemented tests
- Test the root path response, it should return a welcome HTML page.
- Test both endpoints `/select_top_by_playtime` and `/select_top_by_players`, they both should respond with json.
